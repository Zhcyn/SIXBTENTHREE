# SIXBTENTHREE
An alarm clock app that requires a puzzle or math problem to turn it off. The purpose of this app is to wake the brain up a bit so you don't just hit snooze and go back to bed. The current application is still under development, and some functions have not yet been implemented. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me
